    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Malaysia</kbd></h4>
    <hr>
    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited in aug 2018</h5>
 <p class="text-muted">Malaysia is a country located Southeast Asia. I went there with my sister, mum and dad. We went to Kuala Lumpur(the country's capital) and Penang. Malaysia is known for the 451m-tall Petronas Twin Towers, which are the largest set of twin towers in the world. We went to the very top and the view was amazing! We stayed at the Double Tree by Hilton in both places, which was convinient because inside the hotel, there was a big mall. There was also a restaurant opposite named Andrew's Kampung. It served dishes such as Spring Rolls, Samosa, Crispy Wantons and Chicken Fritters. They also served a range of noodles and rice dishes. The service was really good and the staff were very friendly. On our last day, we took a picture with the staff anf they hung it up on their wall next to thousands of other pictures. The whole experience was enjoyable and I had a very fun time. There was also many beaches and aquariums. Everybody, wherever we went, was super kind and helped us. Overall, I had one of the best holidays of my life in Malaysia and it is still the best holiday destination I have been to. </p>

    <p> I watched Encanto with my family and I thought it was a very lovely film. The movie lasts for a total of 1hr 49mins. It is nice to see that Disney is visiting other cultures. This film is based on mexican and spanish culture. It shows you that you don't have to be what everyone else wants you to be and that you shouldn't feel left out because you are different. You should embrace who you are. The ending was a little disappointing. I felt they could have tied it together better and had a gradual come down from the climax. </p>
